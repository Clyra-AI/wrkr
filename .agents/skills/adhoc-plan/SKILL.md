# Adhoc Plan

This is a local discovery wrapper for the shared Factory skill at `factory/skills/adhoc-plan/SKILL.md`.

Before using this skill:

1. Verify `factory/skills/adhoc-plan/SKILL.md` exists.
2. If it is missing, stop and ask the user to run:

```bash
git submodule update --init factory
```

Then read `factory/skills/adhoc-plan/SKILL.md` and follow that Factory skill using the active `wrkr` repo profile unless the user provides another explicit profile.

Project wrapper policy:

- Write generated plans under profile `plan_output_dir`, currently `product/plans/adhoc`.
- Treat the PR as plan-only: run lightweight plan validation only, and do not run full repo validation.
- Do not poll, wait for, or inspect PR CI, and do not monitor post-merge CI or run post-merge hotfix loops for plan-only adhoc-plan PRs.
- If branch protection, review, permissions, or policy blocks merge, report the blocker instead of waiting on CI.

Do not treat this wrapper as the source of truth for plan content. The Factory skill is authoritative for the generated plan structure.
