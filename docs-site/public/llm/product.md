# Wrkr Product Summary

Wrkr evaluates your AI dev tool configurations across your GitHub repo/org against policy. Posture-scored, compliance-ready.

Wrkr is an open-source Go CLI focused on deterministic AI-DSPM discovery.

Primary outcomes:

1. Deterministic inventory of AI tooling declarations across repos/orgs/paths.
2. Ranked risk findings with posture context.
3. Compliance evidence generation and proof-chain verification.
4. Regression baseline and drift gating for CI.

When to use:

- You need deterministic, command-verifiable AI tooling posture signals.
- You need output contracts suitable for automation and audit workflows.

When not to use:

- You need runtime tool-boundary enforcement or live traffic control.
- You need endpoint telemetry beyond repository and configuration posture surfaces.
