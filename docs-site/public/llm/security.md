# Wrkr Security and Privacy

- Fail-closed behavior for unsafe evidence output paths.
- Deterministic command outputs with stable exit codes.
- Static discovery mode by default, avoiding live probing.
- Local-first scan/evidence workflow by default.
- Secret-value extraction is out of scope; only risk context is emitted.
